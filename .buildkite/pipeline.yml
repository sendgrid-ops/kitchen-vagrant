# Welcome to your pipeline.yml file. This file is what controls what is ran during your
# build. This is a direct port of the job you were running in jenkins. We've added
# some suggestions (commented out), but we have not changed any of your logic.
#
# Feel free to change it, but please remember that the more you change it, the
# less we are able to help you figure out what went wrong!

# For information on some of the things you can do inside of this file, please

  # Pipeline revision is our gate that lets you into the new logic.
  # You need to make chef-data consul changes, and chef changes
  # in order to use this new flow. You will probably want to
  # pair with the autobots in order to get this converted.

  # UNCOMMENTING THIS WITHOUT FULLY RUNNING STEPS IN WIKI WILL BREAK YOUR VERSIONING

  # The purpose of the status check script is to add a comment to your

  # If your repo is part of the SOX or SOC2 audit, do not remove this!
